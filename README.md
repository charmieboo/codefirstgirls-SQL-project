## Code First Girls: Introduction to Data Science and SQL Programming Course
I undertook the Introduction to Data Science and SQL Programming course run by Code First Girls that was during winter 2022. It is an 8 week introductory course and was my first experience of databases and SQL. We used MySQL throughout the course and covered:

* database creation, structure and management  
* basic queries  
* queries with conditions, group by, having    
* subqueries  
* joins and the union operator  
* transactions  
* views  
* stored functions  
* stored procedures  
* events  
* triggers  
* backups  

## Course Project
This repository contains my final project that I created as a requirement of the course. It is a database that contains details of bookings made for a bakery. The [delightful_bakes_DB.sql](https://github.com/charmieboo/codefirstgirls-SQL-project/blob/main/delightful_bakes_DB.sql) script contains the code used to create and populate the tables while the [tasks.sql](https://github.com/charmieboo/codefirstgirls-SQL-project/blob/main/delightful_bakes_tasks.sql) script contains the code used to complete the various queries and tasks we were asked to complete such as creating views, stored procedures, running subqueries etc. Tableau was used as a [data visualization tool](https://github.com/charmieboo/codefirstgirls-SQL-project/blob/main/delightful_bakes_dashboard/README.md) for the final results for business-wise prospects such as the popularity of the products and which baker had made them. The project was then presented to the rest of the group remotely on the 8th week of the course ([presentation.pdf](https://github.com/charmieboo/codefirstgirls-SQL-project/blob/main/delightful_bakes_slides.pdf)).
