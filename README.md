## Code First Girls: Introduction to Data Science and SQL Programming Course
I undertook the Introduction to Data Science and SQL Programming course run by Code First Girls that was during winter 2022. It is an 8 week introductory course and was my first experience of databases and SQL. We used MySQL throughout the course and covered:

* database creation, structure and management  
* basic queries  
* queries with conditions, group by, having    
* subqueries  
* joins and the union operator  
* transactions  
* views  
* stored functions  
* stored procedures  
* events  
* triggers  
* backups  

## Course Project
This repository contains my final project that I created as a requirement of the course. It is a database that contains details of bookings made for a bakery. The [delightful_bakes_DB.sql](https://github.com/charmieboo/codefirstgirls-SQL-project/blob/main/delightful_bakes_DB.sql) script contains the code used to create and populate the tables while the [tasks.sql](https://github.com/robynfsj/cfg-SQL-project/blob/master/tasks.sql) script contains the code used to complete the various queries and tasks we were asked to complete such as creating views, stored procedures, running subqueries etc. The repository also contains a backup of the database ([retreat_backup.sql](https://github.com/robynfsj/cfg-SQL-project/blob/master/retreat_backup.sql)). The project was presented to the rest of the group remotely ([presentation.pdf](https://github.com/robynfsj/cfg-SQL-project/blob/master/presentation.pdf)).
